                This honours project exhibits a generative adversarial network (GAN) environment directed to providing users with increased control and security of their own data with respect to image modelling training. Historic limitations have made GAN practices inaccessible. For instance, the constrained nature of compounded datasets and computational resources. As conditions improve, with the advancements in graphics processing units, coupled with the emergence of data science communities such as Kaggle, the proposed environment becomes viable, presenting an innovative solution. The GAN Sandbox is outfitted with an intuitive user interface which conceals the model's intricate underlying logic. By this design, essential features are abstracted, including image processing, routing, and model checkpointing. The platform enables both developers and artists alike to independently train GANs on their own hardware, utilizing custom datasets to explore a multitude of creative ventures in image generation. The application of this project can extend to many domains ranging from computer vision to creative arts.                  </p1>
